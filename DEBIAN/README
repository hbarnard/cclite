This is the fourth version of the cclite package for Debian/Ubuntu based Linux systems

It also includes some tidying up and reskinning for the interface and some minor bug
fixes.

It changes the way mail is sent from Sendmail to Mail::SendMail which is socket based
This will suit the new desktop style system.

The domain is defaulted to cclite.private.server in the hosts file.

When the package is installed on an Ubuntu desktop there should be an explanatory page
at http://cclite.private.server/cclite/
