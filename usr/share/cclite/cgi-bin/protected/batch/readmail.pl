# This is the batch program that reads mail files, processes
# them and unlinks them.
#
# On a linux system it will be run as a cron job..on some
# Windows, as an 'at' of some kind, I guess.
#
# Currently it is designed to read any file of form:
# <registryname>.cclite
#
# It will derive the registry name which is also the database
# name from the mailbox name
#
# To install:
#
# Change the library path and the mail file, since
# this is installation dependent. Probably, one mail file
# will belong to one registry

=head3 readconfiguration

Read the configuration data and return a hash, this routine
also exists in ccserver.cgi


Skip comments marked with #
cgi parameters will override configuration file
information, always!

Included here, needs to be executed within BEGIN

# change these two, if necessary
